- [x] ability to create and export contour curves
- [x] better building height data
- [x] expand parcel source coverage (state + county)
- [x] buildings are not included when multiple tiles are needed
- [x] recent jobs should update automatically
- [x] figure out how to import this into a model effectively
- [x] how to run on windows
- [x] package in a way that doesn't need cli
- [x] user to input coordinates and size only and script to select correct tile programmatically
- [x] enable selecting more than one tile and tiling them correctly
- [x] how do i host this?
- [x] simplify droplet deployment to one stack (production-only, no parallel dev stack)
- [x] what exactly does contour smoothing do
- [x] what exactly does output resolution do?
- [ ] do logo
- [x] Scroll through recent jobs with arrows on the preview
- [x] Edit name of recent job
- [x] Save instead of build. Prompt for project name 
- [x] Add error logging
- [x] Add status messages during build
- [x] Turn off buildings by default (somewhere also put a not that buildings will increase build time and heights are calculated by the mesh and can be inaccurate 
- [ ] refactor again 
- [ ] check for security
- [ ] verify output still works for archicad
